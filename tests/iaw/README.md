# Ion Acoustic Wave (IAW) test

A hybrid-PIC regression test for an ion acoustic wave seeded as a single
sinusoidal ion density perturbation in a uniform, Maxwellian, zero-bulk-velocity
proton plasma.  The setup is matched to the **Hybrid-VPIC** `examples/iaw`
reference so the ion-Landau-damping decay rate can be compared directly.

## Physics

The initial condition is

```
  n(x) = n0 * (1 + pert * sin(kx * x)),    kx = 2*pi*waveMode / Lx
  u_i  = 0   (Maxwellian about zero)
  E    = 0
  B    = 0   (unmagnetized)
```

with `pert = 0.02` and one wavelength across the domain (`waveMode = 1`).  The
restoring force is the electron pressure-gradient ("ambipolar") term in the
generalized Ohm's law

```
  E = -(1/rho) ∇P_e,        P_e = P0 (rho/rho0)^gamma   (adiabatic, gamma = 5/3)
```

With `B = 0` the Hall term `(J x B)/rho` and the convection term `-u_i x B`
both vanish, so this is the **only** electric-field source.  The wave is a
purely electrostatic, collisionless ion acoustic wave whose only damping
mechanism is **ion Landau damping** (`eta = 0`, `hypereta = 0`).

The parameters are matched to Hybrid-VPIC `examples/iaw`:

| Quantity | Hybrid-VPIC | FLEKS (this test) |
|---|---|---|
| Magnetic field | `B = 0` (b0 is only a scale) | `B = 0` |
| Electron polytropic index | `gamma = 5/3` | `5/3` |
| Sound speed `c_s` | 1.0 | `~1` (`electronTemperature` = 15.7 eV) |
| Ion thermal speed `v_thi` | `sqrt(1/3) = 0.577` | `~0.58` (T = 1e5 K) |
| `c_s / v_thi` | 1.73 | 1.73 (same Landau damping) |
| `Lx [d_i]` | 16 | 16 |
| `k d_i` | `2*pi/16 = 0.393` | `2*pi/16 = 0.393` |
| Density perturbation | 0.02 | 0.02 |
| Run time [`omega_ci^-1`] | 50 | 5 (fast regression) |
| `dt` | 0.02 | 0.02 |

The time axis is in `omega_ci^-1` (the `#NORMALIZATION` reference scales set the
reference `wci ~ 1`).

> **Fast regression:** the standalone test runs to `TimeMax = 5` with

> `centerPlasmaPrev` ghost-cell fix (no grid-scale checkerboard). A full

## Implementation

The density perturbation is seeded by the `IonAcousticWave` test case (in
`Pic` / `Particles`): each loaded particle's weight is multiplied by
`(1 + pert * sin(kx * x))`, so the deposited ion density (charge/mass/pressure
moments) carries the sinusoidal profile while the bulk velocity stays uniform.

Activate it in `PARAM.in` with

```
#TESTCASE
testCase  IonAcousticWave
pert      0.02
waveMode  1
```

`pert` is the relative density-perturbation amplitude (must be `< 1`) and
`waveMode` is the number of wavelengths across the x-domain.

## Run

```
python3 tests/validate_tests.py --test=iaw
```

This builds and runs the test, then validates that the run is stable (no NaN;
mass conserved) and that:

1. the seeded density profile is a clean single-mode sinusoid (`rhoS0` in the
   plot output);
2. the **ambipolar electric field `Ex` is non-zero at the last plot frame**
   (the initial `Ex` is zero by construction; a non-zero late-time `Ex` guards
   against the structured plot reading a stale/zero node-centred E and against
   the `centerPlasmaPrev` ghost-cell bug that seeded a spurious boundary
   checkerboard);
3. the density-perturbation amplitude stays bounded (the IAW damps rather than
   blowing up).

Plot-file checks require `PostIDL.exe` (`make PIDL`) and `PostProc.pl`; if those
are unavailable the profile check is skipped and only the stability checks are
enforced.

## Reference

Modeled on the hybrid-VPIC-style wave test (`tests/whistler`), with the
transverse-wave seeding (`HybridWave` test case) replaced by a longitudinal ion
density perturbation (`IonAcousticWave` test case) and the electron
pressure-gradient (`#ELECTRONTEMPERATURE`) providing the restoring force.
Unlike `tests/whistler`, the field is **unmagnetized** (`B = 0`) and the
Hall term is switched off, so this test isolates the electron-pressure
(ambipolar) branch of the Ohm's law and the ion-Landau-damping of a pure
electrostatic IAW.
