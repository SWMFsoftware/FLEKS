"""Validation for the HYBRID_WHISTLER test.

This directory now runs TWO variants of the same whistler eigenmode, driven by
the test runner (tests/validate_tests.py):

  * FULL PIC  (PARAM.in,           base_name = whistler)
      kinetic ions AND kinetic electrons, standard Maxwell/GMRES solver
      (solveEM = T).
  * HYBRID    (PARAM.in.hybrid,     base_name = whistler_hybrid)
      kinetic ions + fluid electrons, generalized Ohm's-law solver
      (useHybridPIC = T, Hall-only).

Both variants seed the identical x-aligned, transverse, circularly-polarized
whistler wave (#TESTCASE HybridWave, frac = 0.02) so the field diagnostics are
directly comparable.  The shared, solver-agnostic checks in tests/_shared/hybrid.py
are used for both:

  * validate_log  -> energy-log checks (finite energies, bounded magnetic
    energy, conserved particle number under periodic BCs).
  * validate_plot -> seeded-wavelength (n=1) check + whistler-dispersion check
    measuring the transverse-wave frequency and comparing it against
    omega/Omega_i = (k d_i)^2 / (1 + (k d_i)^2) from the .out plot frames.

Because the dispersion check lives in tests/_shared/hybrid.py and reads only the
By/Bz components, it applies unchanged to the full-PIC solver output.
