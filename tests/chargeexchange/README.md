# Charge Exchange Source Test (H + O, Chamberlain Neutral Profile)

## Description

This standalone test verifies the `#CHARGEEXCHANGE` command for charge exchange
ionization of analytical neutral exosphere density profiles with **two neutral
components** (H and O) using the **Chamberlain model**. Each neutral component
exchanges charge with **all ion species** (H+ and O+); the resulting source
injects ions into the PIC simulation domain.

## Physics & Solver Setup

- **Geometry & Boundaries**: 1D periodic grid (32 cells in X, 1 in Y, Z),
  domain spans [-9.0×10^6, 9.0×10^6] m (Mars-like scale).
- **Exosphere Model**: Chamberlain profile with 2 neutral components:
  | Component | n0 [m^-3] | H0 [m]   | T0 [K] | Description                  |
  |-----------|-----------|----------|--------|------------------------------|
  | H         | 1.0×10^10 | 2.0×10^6 | 300    | Light species, large scale height |
  | O         | 5.0×10^10 | 3.0×10^5 | 300    | Heavy species, small scale height |

  Density: \( n(r) = n_0 \exp\left[-H_0\left(\frac{1}{R_p} - \frac{1}{r}\right)\right] \) for \( r \geq R_p \).
  Planet radius \( R_p = 3.0 \times 10^6 \) m (Mars-like).

- **Ionization**: Charge exchange, enabled via `#CHARGEEXCHANGE` command.
  The number of neutral components is inherited from `#EXOSPHERE`
  (so `#EXOSPHERE` must precede `#CHARGEEXCHANGE`); the command declares
  only `nIonSpecies` and the `nComponent × nIonSpecies` cross-section
  matrix.  Uses a constant cross-section model:
  \( \langle\sigma v\rangle = \sigma_{\text{CX}} \cdot u_{\text{rel}} \),
  where \( u_{\text{rel}} \) is the ion-neutral relative speed.  The
  neutrals are assumed to be at rest (zero bulk velocity), so the ion
  speed alone is used as the relative speed.  Each neutral component can
  exchange charge with **every** ion species; the total charge-exchange
  frequency for neutral component \(i_C\) is summed over all ion species:
  \( \nu_{\text{CX}}(i_C) = \sum_{iSp} n_{iSp} \cdot \sigma_{\text{CX}}(i_C, iSp) \cdot u_{iSp} \).
  The cross-section matrix (rows = neutral component, columns = ion species):
  | Neutral \ Ion | H+ (sp 1)    | O+ (sp 2)    |
  |---------------|--------------|--------------|
  | H (comp 1)    | 2.0×10^-12   | 1.0×10^-12   |
  | O (comp 2)    | 1.5×10^-12   | 1.0×10^-12   |

  The cross-sections are artificially inflated (realistic values are
  ~10^-15 cm^2) to produce a detectable source signal within the short
  10-step simulation.
  Source mass rate per mapped ion species \(i_C+1\):
  \( S_{\rho,i_C+1} = n_{i_C}(r) \cdot \nu_{\text{CX}}(i_C) \).

- **Plasma Species**:
  | Species | Mass [amu] | Charge [e] | Role                          |
  |---------|------------|------------|-------------------------------|
  | 0 (e-)  | 0.01       | -1         | Electron (quasi-neutral)      |
  | 1 (H+)  | 1.0        | +1         | Background ion (ux=-400 km/s) |
  | 2 (O+)  | 16.0       | +1         | Near-zero background (tiny seed, receives source) |

  The O+ background density is set to 1.0×10^-12 amu/cc (essentially zero)
  so that any O+ particles observed in the simulation are produced by the
  charge exchange source, making the source signal clearly detectable.

- **Electromagnetic Fields**: Enabled (`solveEM = T`) with guiding field
  \( B_x = 5.0 \times 10^{-9} \) T.

## Expected Results

1. **O+ Energy Growth**: The O+ kinetic energy (Epart2) increases by a large
   factor (≥ 2×) over the simulation, since the O+ background is near-zero
   and all O+ particles are produced by the charge exchange source.

2. **H+ Energy Stability**: The H+ kinetic energy (Epart1) does not decrease,
   confirming that the H+ source (from H neutral charge exchange) is active
   without destabilizing the existing H+ population.  The H+ energy increase
   is small relative to the large H+ bulk kinetic energy background.

3. **Source Spatial Profile**: The O+ density (rhoS2) in the plot output
   peaks near the planet surface (|x| ~ Rp) where the exosphere density is
   highest, and is much smaller in the deep interior (|x| < 0.3*Rp) where
   no neutrals exist.  The profile is approximately symmetric about the
   planet center.
