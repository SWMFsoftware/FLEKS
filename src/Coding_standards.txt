1) Avoid using raw pointer and 'new' to allocate memory unless there is a good reason. 
 Try to use shared_ptr or unique_ptr to manage resources. For arrays, using an 
 object to manage resources is a good choice. 

 2) Naming standards:
 a) File name: FileName.cpp, HeaderName.h
 b) Class/structure name: ClassName
 c) Variable name: variableName
 d) Function/method name: this_is_a_function_name

 3) Never put 'using namespace xxx' into a header. 

 4) The order of headers: std headers -> AMReX headers -> user headers

 5) Use 'nullptr' instead of NULL for pointer. 

 6) Always use 'const' as possible. 

 7) Lambda is useful, but a regular function is better if it is universal or it is long. 

8) Using debug flags and Valgrind to check errors.
