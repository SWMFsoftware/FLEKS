# FLEKS — FLexible Exascale Kinetic Simulator

FLEKS is a highly-optimized Particle-In-Cell (PIC) and particle tracker code built on top of the [AMReX](https://amrex-codes.github.io/) block-structured adaptive mesh refinement framework. 

It natively serves as the **PC** (Particle-in-Cell) and **PT** (Particle Tracker) components within the [SWMF](https://github.com/SWMFsoftware) (Space Weather Modeling Framework), heavily coupling with BATS-R-US via the MHD-AEPIC algorithm to provide hybrid kinetic resolution to global MHD models.

## Primary Capabilities
- **Implicit PIC:** Semi-implicit $\theta$-scheme solvers leveraging AMReX GMRES and heavily optimized particle-push boundaries.
- **Particle Tracking:** Massively parallel test particle tracking in turbulent MHD and PIC electromagnetic fields.
- **MHD-AEPIC:** True bi-directional coupling between global space weather MHD states and sub-grid PIC regimes.
- **Adaptive Tracing:** Utilizes AMReX regridding and dynamic load balancing.

## Build Requirements
FLEKS is designed to be built continuously alongside SWMF. See the [SWMF documentation](https://github.com/SWMFsoftware) for environment requirements.
- CMake (Optional, for standalone builds)
- C++14/17 compatible compiler (e.g., `g++` 8+, `clang++` 9+, or `icpc`)
- Fortran 90 compiler (e.g., `gfortran`, `ifort` for `srcInterface/`)
- MPI (MPICH or OpenMPI)

## Quick Start (via SWMF)
To compile the library and the SWMF integrated test scenario:
```bash
# Inside the SWMF root directory
make test16_3d_compile
make test16_3d
```

## Documentation
* **Algorithms & Physics:** Please see `docs/Algorithm.tex` for the mathematical foundations of the simulation engine.
* **Component Architecture:** Every core directory contains an extensive `AGENT.md` file describing layout, file purposing, and structure.
* **Coding Standards & Contributing:** See `CONTRIBUTING.md` before making a pull request.

## Data Processing
All outputs from FLEKS natively stream to AMReX block formats. Do not use generic NetCDF loaders. Please leverage the Python `flekspy` API via:
```bash
pip install flekspy
```
